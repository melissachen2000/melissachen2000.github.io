            <h5>Computer Science Student @ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</h5>
            <p>
                Nice to meet you! My name is Melissa (she/her/hers) and I'm a junior studying computer science at the University 
                of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a minor in mathematics. I'm an aspiring researcher interested in artificial 
                intelligence. Additionally, I am passionate about diversity and inclusion, mental health awareness, and making 
                learning computer science accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please pardon the dust as I get my new webpage up and running!

                    <p>
                        As part of our work as co-chairs of WCS Explorations, my co-chair and I have been working on creating 
                        basic tutorials for a variety of technical tools, a book club to encourage more consideration of ethics 
                        in computer science, and coordinating project teams to help underclassmen gain project experience. Check

                    <p>
                        I get really easily excited about new things, so I've had the opportunity to develop new resources 
                        for WCS members (separate from our Explorations workshops) and improve my web dev skills at the same time.

                    <h5>The Percentage Project</h5>
                    <p>
                        On March 31, 2021, <a href="https://percentageproject.com/" target="_blank">The Percentage Project</a> 
                        launched the 2021 social media campaign. The campaign included 11 schools, including (for the first time!) 
                        the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, thanks to the efforts of our awesome team of 5! 
                        Earlier in the school year, we surveyed ~100 students about their experiences as students at UIUC. We then 
                        put a face to the statistic by encouraging students to pick a statistic that means a lot to them and taking 
                        a photo with it.

                        As the events chair of the committee, I've been lucky to be able to work on a variety of events to raise 
                        awareness for mental health and related advocacy initiatives through events. We've held events such as 
                        a panel on mental health during the pandemic and de-stressing nights. Our next big initiative is to plan 
                        an engineering mental health conference! It's still a filler site for now, but stay tuned to <a href=

                        workshop about data visualization and this semester I'm helping with an artificial intelligence workshop.

        <p>
            I've been really fortunate to be participating in research this semester. By coincidence, both projects are at 
            the intersection of crop science and computer science, but I've really enjoyed my experience so far.

                        This semester, I am a SPIN research intern at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications. My 
                        task for the semester is to determine which crops are growing where based on satellite imagery taken 
                        at a variety of different resolutions.

                        baseline metrics for the pipeline.

                    <p>
                        The spring and summer after my PURE project, I continued working with my mentor on learning about missing data 
                        in neural networks. I performed a literature survey and started implementing a neural network that used informative 
                        missingness, the idea that missing data has a helpful pattern that can be used to help classify data.

                        Computer Architecture. My daily tasks include helping in lecture and office hours as 
                        well as helping to digitize homework questions for pandemic learning. Being on course 
                        staff has been a really interesting experience especially because of all the changes that 
                        were made to the course to accommodate students during the pandemic.

                        <strong>HackIllinois 2020 Co-director</strong> In February 2020, right before the pandemic hit, 
                        I was one of the co-directors of the premiere open source hackathon. With a team of 50, we hosted 1000
                        people (800 attendees, 35 mentors, 17 companies, and 200 volunteers) for 36 hours. They worked on a variety 
                        of open source projects that are used by thousands from around the world. It was an incredible experience 
                        to work with so many talented people to host one of the last large events for the university before 
                        social distancing began. More information about the event is available at <a href="http://2020.hackillinois.org/"

                        decreased experiment runtime by half and created an intuitive UI to expedite feature extractor
