            <h5>Computer Science Student @ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</h5>
            <p>
                Nice to meet you! My name is Melissa (she/her/hers) and I'm a junior studying computer science at the University 
                of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a minor in mathematics. I'm an aspiring researcher interested in artificial 
                intelligence. Additionally, I am passionate about diversity and inclusion, mental health awareness, and making 
                learning computer science accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please pardon the dust as I get my new webpage up and running!

                    <h5>WCS Explorations</h5>
                    <p>
                        As part of our work as co-chairs of WCS Explorations, my co-chair and I have been working on creating 
                        basic tutorials for a variety of technical tools, a book club to encourage more consideration of ethics 
                        in computer science, and coordinating project teams to help underclassmen gain project experience. Check 
                        out our workshop slides and resources on the <a href="http://wcs.illinois.edu/explorations/index.html" 
                        target="_blank">Explorations webpage!</a>

                    <p>
                        I get really easily excited about new things, so I've had the opportunity to develop new resources 
                        for WCS members (separate from our Explorations workshops) and improve my web dev skills at the same time.

                    <h5>The Percentage Project</h5>
                    <p>
                        On March 31, 2021, <a href="https://percentageproject.com/" target="_blank">The Percentage Project</a> 
                        launched the 2021 social media campaign. The campaign included 11 schools, including (for the first time!) 
                        the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, thanks to the efforts of our awesome team of 5! 
                        Earlier in the school year, we surveyed ~100 students about their experiences as students at UIUC. We then 
                        put a face to the statistic by encouraging students to pick a statistic that means a lot to them and taking 
                        a photo with it.

                    <h5>CS Mental Health Committee</h5>
                    <p>
                        As the events chair of the committee, I've been lucky to be able to work on a variety of events to raise 
                        awareness for mental health and related advocacy initiatives through events. We've held events such as 
                        a panel on mental health during the pandemic and de-stressing nights. Our next big initiative is to plan 
                        an engineering mental health conference! It's still a filler site for now, but stay tuned to <a href=
                        "http://conference.csmhcillinois.com/" target="_blank">our website</a> for more details.

                    <p>
                        I'm really lucky to help teach workshops to a group of grade 3 through 12 girls! Last semester, I led a 
                        workshop about data visualization and this semester I'm helping with an artificial intelligence workshop.
