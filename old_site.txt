# Projects

## HackIllinois: A Journey

This [blog post](https://blog.hackillinois.org/recap/2019/08/14/hackillinois-a-journey.html) discusses the trials and success of HackIllinois staffs from 2014 to 2019 and looks forward to the planning process for HackIllinois 2020

## Non-negative matrix factorization on cancer gene expression data

My freshman year research project uses non-negative matrix factorization to analyze cancer gene expressions. View my poster and code on [my github](https://github.com/melissachen2000/cancer-gene-expression-nmf/).

## Safeways

[Safeways](https://github.com/Safeways/safeways) is a webapp that plots the safest route between two points on campus, avoiding recent and frequent crime locations.
